# Web Application Penetration Testing

### Local File Inclusion

File Inclusion vulnerabilities are commonly found in poorly written PHP web-applications where the input parameters are not properly sanitized or validated

Local file inclusion is the vulnerability in which an attacker tries to trick the web-application by including the files that are already present locally into the server. It arises when a php file contains some php functions such as “include”, “include_once”, “require”, “require_once”.
